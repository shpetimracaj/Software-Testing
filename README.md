# Software Testing and Development Portfolio

This repository showcases my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. It includes the `ContactService` files from Project One and a summary and reflections report from Project Two.

## Project One: Contact Service
- **Files Included:**
  - `Contact.java`
  - `ContactService.java`
  - `ContactTest.java`
  - `ContactServiceTest.java`

These files demonstrate my ability to create unit tests to uncover errors and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet software requirements.

## Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report
This report highlights my experience and approach in software testing, focusing on techniques, strategies, and reflections on the testing process.

## Reflections

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality and security, I employ rigorous testing, including unit tests to validate each component and integration tests to ensure seamless interactions. I adhere to secure coding practices and implement input validation, which helps protect against vulnerabilities and ensures the program operates as intended.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs involves active communication and thorough analysis of requirements. I translate these needs into technical specifications, designing features that align with user expectations. This process ensures that the program is both functional and user-friendly, meeting the demands of the end-users.

### How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by first understanding the problem domain and defining clear requirements. I use design principles to create scalable and maintainable architectures, focusing on modular design to enable flexibility and ease of maintenance. This structured approach helps ensure the software is robust and adaptable to future changes.
